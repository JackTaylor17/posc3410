# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Add some wrinkles to the OLS regression framework.*

### Introduction

By this point, I think you could be doing your own research.

- You know what variables are.
- You know how to describe them.
- You know how to propose an explanation for variations in them.
- You know how to set up a research design to test an argument.
- You even know how to interpret a regression coefficient!

### Limitations in Bivariate Regression

However, simple bivariate OLS is never enough.

- Variables of interest in political science are rarely interval.
- Bivariate regression does not control for confounders.

This lecture will deal with those topics accordingly.

# Extending OLS
## Dummy Variables as Predictors
### Dummy Variables as Predictors

Dummy variables are everywhere in political science.

- They play an important role in "fixed effects" regression.
- Sometimes we're just interested in the effect of "one thing".

### The South and Voter Turnout

Return to our education and turnout example: what if we're just interested in the effect of the South?

- We'll code states in the South as 1.
- When *x* = 0, we have the *y*-intercept.

### The South and Voter Turnout

![Table 8-3 in Pollock (2012)](tab83.pdf)

### The South and Voter Turnout

- The estimate turnout in non-southern states is 46.34%
- The estimated turnout in the South is 36.9%.
- The "South effect" is -9.44 (se: 1.98).
- *t*-statistic: -9.44/1.98 = -4.78

## Fixed Effects in Regression
### Fixed Effects and Voter Turnout

Obviously, this regression isn't that informative.

- It also problematically treats non-Southern states as homogenous.

We can specify other regions as "fixed effects".

- These treat predictors as a series of dummy variables for each value of *x*.
- One predictor (or group) is left out as "baseline category".
	- Otherwise, we'd have no *y*-intercept.

### Fixed Effects and Voter Turnout

![Table 8-4 in Pollock (2012)](tab84.pdf)

### Fixed Effects and Voter Turnout

How to interpret Table 8-4:

- All coefficients communicate the effect of that region versus the baseline category.
	- This is the Midwest in our example.
- Estimated turnout in the Midwest is 48.73%.
- Northeast turnout doesn't different much from the Midwest (*t* = -.95).
- Turnout may be lower in the West than the Midwest (*t* = -1.69).
- The effect of the South is to depress turnout when compared to Midwest states.

## Multiple Regression
### Multiple Regression

Your previous example is basically an applied **multiple regression**.

- However, it lacks control variables.

Multiple regression produces **partial regression coefficients**.

### Multiple Regression

Let's return to our state voter turnout example. Let:

- $x_1$: % of citizens in state having at least a HS diploma.
- $x_2$: states in the South.

### Multiple Regression

![Table 8-5 in Pollock (2012)](tab85.pdf)

### Multiple Regression

- Estimate turnout for state not in the South in which no one graduated from high school: 3.7%.
- The partial regression coefficient for education: .74 (*t* = 3.24).
- The partial regression coefficient for the South: -7.57 (*t* = -4.00).

## Interaction Effects
### Interaction Effects

Multiple regression is linear and additive.

- However, some effects (say: $x_1$) may depend on the value of some other variable (say: $x_2$).

In regression, we call this an **interaction effect**.

### A Real World Example

Consider this argument from Zaller (1992):

- Democrats are weakly more pro-choice than Republicans.
- However, the difference is very stark among the politically aware.

Let's first start by visualizing this.

### Controlled Comparison Table

![Table 8-6 in Pollock (2012)](tab86.pdf)

### Interaction Effects

Our regression formula would look like this:

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{a} + \hat{b_1}(x_1) + \hat{b_2}(x_2) + \hat{b_3}(x_1*x_2)
$$

where:

- $\hat{y}$ = estimated pro-choice scale score.
- $x_1$ = partisanship (0 = Dems, 1 = Ind., 2 = GOP).
- $x_2$ = political knowledge (0 = low, 1 = high).
- $x_1 * x_2$ = product of the two variables.

### Interaction Effects

![Table 8-7 in Pollock (2012)](tab87.pdf)

### Interaction Effects

How to interpret Table 8-7:

- Our estimate of pro-choice scores is 4.33 for low-knowledge Democrats.
-  $\hat{b_1}$, $\hat{b_2}$, and $\hat{b_3}$ are all statistically significant.
- When $x_1$ and $x_2$ $=$ 1, subtract -.76 from $\hat{y}$.
- Political knowledge leads to higher pro-choice scores *among Democrats*.

What this does for Republicans is kind of interesting.

- $\hat{y}$ for low-knowledge Republicans: 2.93.
- $\hat{y}$ for high-knowledge Republicans: 2.91.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

This chapter is the culmination of everything discussed previously.

- It's basically what quantitative political science is.

Regrettably, we can only use OLS for interval-level dependent variables.

- We rarely have that.
- Next, we'll discuss what to do with non-normal responses.
