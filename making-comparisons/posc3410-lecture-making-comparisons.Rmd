# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Introduce students to basic making of comparisons between an independent variable and dependent variable.*

### Theories and Hypotheses

We previously discussed the importance of theory-writing.

- Theories are conceptual, representing your ideas and arguments.
	- Itâ€™s the hardest part of political science, but the most important.

Some general things to consider:

- "Keep it Kosher"
- Speak conceptually. Test operationally.
- Don't fit theory to data.

We also discussed proper construction of hypotheses (i.e. testable statements).

# Making Comparisons
### Making Comparisons

This lecture will instruct on how to make comparisons among your independent variable and dependent variable.

- Consider this a kind of "first cut" of inferential statistics.
- A lot of peer-reviewed scholarship begins with the following tools.

We will begin to see if there is a preliminary association between our independent variable and dependent variable.

## Cross-tabulation
### Cross-tabulation

A **cross-tabulation** has three rules in its presentation.

1. Independent variable is the column. Dependent variable is the row.
2. *Always* calculate percentages for the *independent* variable.
3. Interpret a cross-tab by comparing columns across the *same* value of the dependent variable.

## Mean Comparisons
### Mean Comparisons

When our dependent variable is interval, we can use a **mean comparison table**.

- It shows the mean of a dependent variable for different values of the independent variable.

## Graphing Relationships
### Bar Charts and Line Charts

Graphically displaying data will help us make comparisons.

- Both communicate percentages or means of a dependent variable, for each value of an independent variable.
- Differ in representation (bars or markers connected by lines).

In each case, the independent variable is the *x*-axis. Dependent variable is the *y*-axis.

### Types of Relationships

There are four types of relationships

1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Curvilinear
4. Zero

### Types of Relationships

Note: curvilinear may also be a "normal-U"

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

We have several tools to make a preliminary association between dependent variable and independent variable.

- e.g. cross-tabs, mean comparison table, bar chart, line chart.

**Use them!**

- Our inferential statistical tools tend to assume linearity.
- Look carefully if there is a non-linear trend between your variables.
