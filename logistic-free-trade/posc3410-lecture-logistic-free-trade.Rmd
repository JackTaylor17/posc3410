### Goal for Today

*Explore public opinions about free trade.*

# An Analysis of Attitudes toward Free Trade
### What Do Citizens Think About Free Trade?

![Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have both railed against free trade](trump_sanders_split.jpg)

## The Ongoing Free Trade Debate
### The Ongoing Free Trade Debate

Free trade is an integral part of U.S. economic policy.

- Important origins in post-WWII international economic order.
- Promoted through BWIs like the ITO during Cold War.
- Post Cold War: NAFTA, WTO

Free trade is one area of consensus among Republican and Democrat elites.

### Arguments for Free Trade

Political scientists/economists tend to agree on free trade too.

- Free trade promotes world peace
- Free trade breaks down cultural barriers
- Free trade promotes economic development in developing world
- Free trade increases total production and efficiency
- Free trade leads to competition and innovation

I'd be hard-pressed to find the political economist or economist that does not support free trade in theory or practice.

### Arguments Against Free Trade

- Free trade increases offshoring/outsourcing
- Free trade depresses wages
- Free trade only benefits the wealthy within wealthy countries
- Free trade makes capital "too mobile"
- Developing countries may artificially depress wages (e.g. China)

Free trade, like any policy, creates winners and losers.

- Those who lose want to revise free trade policy/agreements.

### Is This an Honest Debate?

Political scientists/economists bemoan that this debate kind of misses the point.

- Drezner: most of the criticism rests on an image that's at least ten years out of date.

### Manufacturing Output in the U.S.

![Manufacturing Output Since 1989](manufacturing-1.png)

### Manufacturing Jobs in the U.S.

![Manufacturing Jobs Since 1989](manufacturing-2.png)

### What About China?

China is a special case for negative externalities of free trade in the U.S.

- Enormous size
- Low income/wages
- Government promotion of esports
- Purposely depressed exchange rate

### China Today

However, this is changing.

- China's trade level has flatlined
- Its growth has slowed
- Wages have skyrocketed
- Its currency is now *over*valued

### Free Market = Moving Target

Treat it for what it is: a market

- Those who moved early into China/India/Mexico found the best workers.
- Those who could relocate already have.

### The Emergence of "Reshoring"

![Manufacturing Jobs Returning to U.S. Since 2008](reshoring.jpg)

### Perception != Reality

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=" Do you favor/oppose placing new limits on imports? (ANES 2012)"}
ANES2012$limitimports <- with(ANES2012, recode(imports_limit, "-9:-2=NA; 1=1; 2=0"))
limitimports <- as.factor(ANES2012$limitimports)

ggplot(ANES2012, aes(x=limitimports)) + 
  geom_bar(width=.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(name="", breaks=c(0,1), labels=c("Oppose", "Favor")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="")

```

## An Argument about Education
### Advancing an Explanation

I propose a simple explanation for variation in support for free trade: education

- Less educated citizens are most vulnerable to globalization.
- The benefits of free trade typically aren't taught in high school.

This makes sense anecdotally:

- Trump: "I love the poorly educated"
- Sanders' support seems to come from "millennials".

### A Possible Interaction?

This might be contingent on partisanship. Anecdotally:

- Democrats championed free trade and Republicans don't question it.
- Sanders is nominally still an "independent"
- Trump brings in "Reagan Democrat" and "first-time voters" [which is a bit misleading, but alas].

### Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis 1

Higher levels of education = more support for free trade

#### Hypothesis 2

Less educated citizens with less affinity to GOP/Dems = more likely to oppose free trade

## Research Design
### Research Design

I gathered data from the 2016 pilot study for ANES.

- n = 1,200
- Respondents from across the country, including territories.

**DV**: Do you favor or oppose the U.S. making free trade agreements with other countries?

- Seven-point scale [favor a great deal:oppose a great deal]
- I condense it to a binary measure: 
    - 1 = favor a great deal/moderately favor
    - 0 = favor a little:oppose a great deal
    
I'm sure this could be done better, but this is for illustration.

### Research Design

**IVs**:

- Age (in years)
- Sex (female)
- Race (fixed effects [white, black, hispanic, other])
- Education (high school education or less)
- Unemployed
- Party ID (strong GOP, strong Dem)

**Model**:

- logistic regression

Code is available in this powerpoint/on my Github

### Results

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
M1 <- glm(msupfreetrade ~ z.age + female + factor(race4) + 
                    hsedorless + unemployed + 
            strongrep + strongdem,
          data=Data, family=binomial(link="logit"))

M2 <- glm(msupfreetrade ~ z.age + female + factor(race4) + 
                    hsedorless + unemployed + 
            strongrep + strongdem + 
              hsedorless:strongrep + hsedorless:strongdem,
          data=Data, family=binomial(link="logit"))

stargazer(M1, M2, header=FALSE, font.size="footnotesize", style="ajps",
          title="Attitudes About Free Trade (ANES, 2016)",
          omit.stat=c("ll","aic"),
          model.names= FALSE, dep.var.labels.include = FALSE,
          covariate.labels=c("Age", "Female", "Race=Black", "Race=Hispanic", "Race=Other",
                             "HS ed or less", "Unemployed", "Strong GOP", "Strong Dem",
                             "HS ed or less*Strong GOP", "HS ed or less*Strong Dem"),
          single.row=TRUE
          )


```

### Interpretation of Results

- Women are less likely to support free trade than men
- Black respondents are more likely to support free trade than white respondents
- Strong Republicans/Democrats support free trade more than those in between both ends.

### Interpretation of Results

Let's look at the strong Republicans:

- Effect of strong affinity w/ GOP = increase of .524 in natural logged odds of supporting free trade.
- Odds ratio: exp(.524) = 1.688
- Percentage change in odds: 100*(exp(.524) - 1) = 68.87%

### Interpretation of Results

Model 2 tests for a possible interaction.

- Strong Dem no longer significant
    - Actually effect of Strong Dems with more than HS education
- Strong GOP (with HS education or more) still significant

*Effect of HS education or less is significant among those w/o strongest affinity to either party.*

### A Visualization

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE}

M3 <- bglmer(msupfreetrade ~ z.age + female + hsedorless + unemployed + factor(race4) +
             (1 + hsedorless | partyid),
            data=Data, family=binomial(link="logit"))

ggCaterpillar(ranef(M3,condVar=TRUE), QQ=FALSE, likeDotplot=TRUE, reorder=FALSE)[["partyid"]] 


```

# Conclusion
### Conclusion 

Free trade is an ongoing policy debate.

- Political scientists/economists support it.
- It's a rare consensus among Democrat/Republican elites.
- However, a large part of the general public isn't sold on free trade's benefits.

I offer an example logistic regression that hints at why.

- Strong GOP/Dems still support free trade.
- Lower education = less support for those in between both ends.
