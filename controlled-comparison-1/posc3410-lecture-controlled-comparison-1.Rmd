# Introduction
### Goal for Today

- *Introduce students to making controlled comparisons and understanding controlled relationships.*
- *Discuss importance of controlling for rival explanations*.
- *Introducing three different types of controlled relationships*.

### A Brief Review

What we have done to this point:

- We have an interest in a relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable.
- We already know our types of relationships.

### How Do We Get Our Data?

Our standard research design is similar to an **experimental design** with **random assignment**.

- Complete with **test group** and **control group**.

Experiments are either **lab experiments** or **field experiments**.

- Lab experiments: greater **internal validity** than **external validity**.
- Field experiments: vice-versa. Think of the GOTV example.

### The Problem of Selection

Experimental design with random assignment can lead to proper inference about relationship between *x* and *y*.

- However, we often deal with observational or event data.
- We must deal with the problem of **selection** all the same.

It could be some third process (*z*) that is responsible for the relationship between *x* and *y*.

- We account for this by making **controlled comparisons**.

# Types of Controlled Relationships
### Types of Controlled Relationships

There are three types of controlled relationships among *x*, *y*, and *z*.

1. Spurious relationship
2. Additive relationship
3. Interactive relationship

## Spurious Relaionship
### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

We will use the partisanship, gender, gun control example from your book.

- We already discussed the theory linking partisanship and gun control.
- However, Democrats tend to have more women than men.
	- This is an essential **compositional difference**.

There is good reason to expect gender confounds our partisanship-gun control inference.

### Partisanship and Gun Control

![](fig41.pdf)

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

What if we believe gender is responsible for this relationship?

- Figure 4.1 would not let us know.
- Figure 4.2 would let us know in an obvious way.

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

![](fig42.pdf)

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

What is the effect of partisanship on gun control opinions, *controlling* for gender?

- Nine of 12 women favored gun control.
- Six of eight female Dems favored gun control (i.e. 75%)
- Three of four female Republicans favored gun control (i.e. 75%).

Of the men:

- One male Dem favored while three opposed (i.e. 25%).
- Two GOP men favored while six opposed (25%).

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

Gender explains everything in this example.

- Formally: the effect of *x* on *y* is **spurious** to *z*.

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

![](fig43.pdf)

## Additive Relationship
### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

Consider this arrangement.

![](fig44.pdf)

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

Among the women:

- Four of six Democrats favor gun control (66.6%).
- Three of six Republicans favor gun control (50%).

Among the men:

- Two of six Democrats favor gun control (33.3%)
- One in six GOP men favor gun control (16.6%).

This is an **additive relationship**.

- *x* and *z* affect *y* independently.

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

![](fig45.pdf)

## Interactive Relationships
### Interactive Relationships

**Interactive relationships** are more difficult to fully describe.

- Simply: *x* and *z* act in concert to affect *y*
- Put another way: the effect of *x* on *y* depends on the value of *z*.

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

Consider this arrangement.

![](fig47.pdf)

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

Among the women:

- Four of seven Democrats favor gun control (57.1%)
- Two of four Republicans favor gun control (50%).

Among the men:

- Three of five Democrats favor gun control (60%).
- Three of eight Republicans favor gun control (37.8%).

Put another way: the effect of partisanship is strong for men, less for women.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

- Experiments with random assignment are the gold standard for inference.
- Barring that: no bivariate relationship without control is sufficient for inference.
- There are three types of controlled relationships worth knowing in multivariate analysis.



<!--
# Applied Controlled Comparisons
### Applied Controlled Comparisons

We can summarize these controlled relationships with:

1. Cross-tabulation
2. Mean comparison analysis

We will also use actual data.

### Partisanship and Gun Control

![](tab51.pdf)

### Zero-order Relationship

Table 5.1 illustrates a **zero-order relationship**.

- This is the effect of *x* on *y* **not** contorlling for *z*.

The zero-order effect of partisanship on attitudes toward gun control is 18.

### Partisanship, Gender, and Gun Control

Consider this arrangement.

![](tab52.pdf)

## Controlled and Partial Effects
### Controlled Comparison Table

Table 5.2 is a **controlled comparison table**.

- It shows the relationship between *x* and *y* for each value of *z*.

These tables reveal two types of relationships.

1. Controlled effect
2. Partial effect

### Controlled Effect

A **controlled effect** is a relationship between *x* and *y* within one value of *z*.

- It could also be between *z* and *y* within one value of *x*.

We obtain the controlled effect of partisanship for both women and men.

- 91.5% of female Dems favor permits to 74.9% of female Republicans.
	- The controlled effect is 16.6 percentage points.
- 80.8% of male Dems favor permits to 61.1% of male Republicans.
	- The controlled effect is 19.7 percentage points.

### Partial Effect

We summarize controlled effects as **partial effect**.

- Summarizes a relationship between two variables taking into account rival variables.

It's tempting, but *don't average the two controlled effects*.

- Doing so assumes the samples are equal.

Instead: weight the controlled effect by percentage of the sample.

- In our case: 16.6 * (.562) + 19.7 * (.438) = 17.96

The partial effect of partisanship on gun control opinions is 17.96.

### Partial Effect

What is the partial effect of *gender* on gun control attitudes?

- Sounds weird to ask. No one "increases" in gender.

Follow the **rule of direction for nominal relationships**.

- Treat the left-most column as the base category (here: women).

### Partial Effect of Gender on Gun Control

Controlled effects:

- 91.5% of female Dems favor permits to 80.8% of male Dems (10.7%).
- 74.9% of female Republicans favor permits to 61.1% of male Republicans (13.8).

Weight the controlled effects to get a partial effect.

- 10.7*(.570) + 13.8*(.430) = 12.03

The partial effect of gender on gun control opinions is 12.03.

## Identifying the Pattern
### Identifying the Pattern

Ask the following three questions for relationships among *x*, *y*, and *z*.

1. Does a relationship exist between *x* and *y* in at least one value of *z*?
2. Is the tendency (i.e. positive or negative) the same at all values of *z*?
3. Is the magnitude effect the same or close to it in all values of *z*?

### Identifying the Pattern

If the answer to the first question is no, you can stop there.

- It's a spurious relationship.

If the answer to the second question is no, you can stop there.

- There's an interaction effect.

If the answer to the third question is no, there's an interaction.

- If "yes", it's an additive relationship.

## A Clear Example of an Interaction
### Abortion Opinions, Salience, and Vote Choice

Consider the following controlled comparison table.

![](tab53.pdf)

### Abortion Opinions, Salience, and Vote Choice

The controlled effect of abortion opinion:

- 63.2 - 45.9 for "low" = 17.3
- 82 - 34.9 for "high" = 47.1
- Partial effect: 17.3 * (.495) + 47.1 * (.505) = 32.3

Controlled effect of salience:

- 63.2 - 82 for "always permit" = -18.8
- 45.9 - 34.9 for "not always permit" = 11
- Partial effect: -18.8 * (.416) + 11 * (.584) = -1.39

Something already looks a lot different here.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

No causal statement can be made as a zero-order relationship

- This will get more complicated in multiple regression
- Fortunately, computers do the heavy lifting for us.

Get comfortable making these types of controlled comparisons within a simple three-variable context. -->
