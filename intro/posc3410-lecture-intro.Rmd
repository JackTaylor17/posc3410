# Introduction
### Goal for Today

Familiarize students with the topic of the course and the instructor's expectations.

### Evaluating Arguments in Political Science

![](cnncrossfire.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

How should we evaluate competing arguments in political science?

### Arguments in Political Science

Our discipline is ever in pursuit of an "answer", but we have only *answers*.

 - Why are Americans intolerant of political difference?
 - Why do court justices vote the predictable way they do?
 - Why do states fight wars?
 - Are democracies really conducive to peace?
 - Is a bourgeoisie necessary for democracy?

\bigskip All these questions and more have competing answers.

- How do we evaluate them?

### Quantifying Political Science

The most common method is through the use of inferential statistics.

 - Inference about a population can be obtained from a sample of the population.
 - Phenomena of interest can be quantified into variables of interest.
 - Approriate statistical tools exist that can inform us of general tendency and cause-and-effect.

\bigskip In short: knowledge is better obtained through quantification and inferential statistics, not hollow rhetoric.

# POSC 3410 Syllabus
### Course Objectives

 - Understand concepts and how we operationalize abstract concepts for the sake of testing.
 -  Delineate variables among various types, like nominal, ordinal and interval.
 -  Put together a formal research design to address questions of interest in the study of politics.
 -  Express why the logic of control is vital to any good research design.
 - Understand important elements of data, like central tendency and spread.
 -  Become familiar with advanced topics like non-normal responses, Bayesian thinking, and post-estimation simulation.

### Books

 -  Pollock III, Phillip H. 2012. *The Essentials of Political Analysis*. Washington DC: CQ Press, 4th edition
 - Lynch, Scott M. 2013. *Using Statistics in Social Research: A Concise Approach*. New York, NY: Springer



### Grading Policy and Important Dates

- Midterm: (September 24) [**20%**]
- Three problem sets: (due periodically through semester) [**20%**]
	- You also have a prospectus (October 8), which will be graded as a problem set.
- Research design paper: (due *before* December 4, 9 a.m.) [**20%**]
    - See syllabus for pertinent information.
- Final: (December 11, 11:30 a.m.) [**30%**]

Attendance and participation will be the final 10% of your grade.

## Course Policies
### Lab Policy

When you enroll in POSC 3410, you also have to enroll in POSC 3411 (the lab).

\bigskip However, there is no "lab" portion of this class.

- There is homework, but this can be done on your laptop in your dorm/apartment.
- These are part of the 3410 grade, not 3411.


\bigskip However, I welcome students who want free statistical consulting!

- If you're serious about applied statistics, let me know.
- Preference will be given to instruction in the R language.

### The R Programming Language

Your homework will be done in the R programming
language.

-   It’s a *free* and open source programming language preferred
    by statisticians.
-   Download it from cran.r-project.org.
-   **Recommended:** download and install Rstudio afterward, available for free at rstudio.com.

\bigskip R scripts designed me should work with minimal
maintenance.

-   I’ll make directions clear in the homework.

I will assume that not meeting with me means the student is
fluent with the software.

-   I put together a beginner’s guide on the course website.




### Course Policies

*Read the syllabus*. I'll reiterate the following:

- **Attendance**: Effectively mandatory. You get five unexcused absences.
- **Participation**: I may "cold-call" you to answer a question. 
    - You should *at least* give a convincing partial answer.
    - If you don't (or are absent), you'll get a point deduction from your overall grade.
- **Make-up Exams**: Don't bother asking. The answer is no.
- **Cell phones, laptops, etc.**: Put them away.
- **Academic dishonesty**: Don't be that guy...
- **Disabilities**: let me know ASAP (privately) if you need accommodations
    - Student must initiate the process *each semester*.
    - Student must schedule room at testing center (if necessary).

# Etiquette and Expectations
### My Contact Information

- *Name*: Steve Miller (as in the band)
- *E-mail*: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{svmille@clemson.edu}
- *Office Hours*: Wednesday: 9-11:30 a.m.
- *Office*: 230A Brackett Hall
- *Website*: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{svmiller.com/teaching}

### Additional Course Materials

I don't like Blackboard. I only intend to use it for:

- Turnitin (and grading the Turnitin assignments)
- Classwide e-mails

\bigskip I do like making lectures publicly available, though.

- Check course website at \textcolor{clemsonorange}{svmiller.com}
- Check my Github repository (just in case): \textcolor{clemsonorange}{github.com/svmiller/posc3410}

### My Expectations

I come off as a bit cruel in my expectations.

- I expect a lot, and I expect a commitment from you.
- Otherwise, why bother? Your job is to become "pro-ready".

\bigskip I also expect it to be a bit difficult for you.

- My philosophy: if you 100% understand something the first time you read it, you didn't learn anything.
- Read and re-read if necessary.
- Lectures should help, but they're not sufficient. You need to read.

\bigskip I take seriously the "science" of political science.

- This may not be intuitive, but I'm also eager to help in-class or office hours.

\bigskip I don't care for whom you'll vote or what you saw on TV. *Don't bring it up*.


### Etiquette Concerns

In-class:

- Raise your hand and ask a question the *moment* something doesn't make sense.
    - I do have a bad habit of talking a bit fast.
- *Do the reading before class*. Seriously.
- Resist the urge to write down every word on a slide.
    - Listening is more important than reading in this context.

### Etiquette Concerns

Outside class: 

- **Resist the urge** to e-mail me if you missed a class (for which there wasn't an exam).
    - Short answer: you missed what was on the syllabus.
- Please use conventional e-mail etiquette.
    - This is a good professional exercise for you.
- I'm usually in my office Tuesday and Thursday mornings before class.
- Knock first, even when the door is open.
- You may not use my office supplies.
- I am not a study session. Come prepared with something specific to ask or discuss.
