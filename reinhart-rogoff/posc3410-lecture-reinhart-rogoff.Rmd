# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Discuss Reinhart and Rogoff's (2010) analysis of government debt and growth.*

# Debt and Growth as Current Policy Issue
### Debt and Growth as Current Policy Issue

The financial crisis of 2007-08 was not kind to many countries.

- Overdetermined causes: housing bubble, bank insolvencies, predatory lending, deregulation since 1999, etc.
- The great recession followed in 2009.

### The Effect of the Great Recession

![Growth Rates in 2009, Globally](growth2009.png)

### The Effect of the Great Recession

USA:

- Unemployment doubled, rising to 10.1% (highest in 30+ years)
- GDP *shrunk* from 2008 to mid-2010.
- Debt rose from 2/3rds GDP to over 100% of GDP.

Greece:

- Unemployment rose from 6% to 21% in three years.
- GDP contracted by over 20%.

Ireland:

- Unemployment rose from 6% to 15% in four years.
- Stock exchange hit a 14-year low.

# Reinhart and Rogoff's Argument
### Dealing with the Great Recession

Countries dealt with recession in the usual way: bailouts and deficit spending.

- Governments accrue debt to prevent further economic losses.

Reinart and Rogoff (RR) (2010) argue this is unwise.

- Debt accumulation like we're seeing now coincides with slowing growth (or, worse, further contraction).

### Reinhart and Rogoff's Method

Let's understand RR's research design.

- *Hypothesis*: as debt goes up, GDP growth goes down.

**Variables**:

- *DV*: GDP growth
- *IV*: public debt/GDP ratio
    - RR treat it as a series of fixed effects/factors.

## Findings
### Findings

RR provide "stylized facts" to illustrate debt/GDP and growth.

![Figure 2 from RR (2010)](rr2010fig2.png)

### Findings

- No relationship between debt/GDP and growth for bottom three debt categories.
- However, >90% and above category shows average GDP loss.
- No relationship between debt/GDP and inflation (the line graph).

### Findings

![The disputed statistics in question (from the NBER working paper)](rr2010atab1.png)

## The Importance of These Findings
### Policy Impact

RR make one of the loudest claims of the negative debt-GDP relationship. Impact includes:

- Numerous well-placed op-eds.
- Testimony before Congress.
- Features on FOX, NPR, MSNBC
- It also became the basis for the Ryan budget and similar austerity measures in Europe.

### Policy Impact


![I'll never not include these photos when I can](paulryan.jpg)

Paul Krugman (not pictured): RR may have had more immediate influence than any paper in history of economics.

### Policy Impact

Fiscal priorities in the West still reflect RR's findings.

- Follow politics closely and you'll see it.

However, the policy implications follow only if RR's findings are robust.

# Replicating Reinhart and Rogoff
### Replicating Reinhart and Rogoff

Question: did RR actually do their research well? How would we know?

- Fortunately, RR made their data publicly available.

### Read in the Data

\scriptsize
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE,  tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=50)}
library(RCurl)
library(Zelig)
library(countrycode)
library(ggplot2)
library(mgcv)

data <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svmiller/reinhart-rogoff/master/RR-processed.csv")
Data <- read.csv(text = data)
```
\normalsize

### Do Some Recoding/Cleaning

\small
```{r eval=FALSE}
Data <- subset(Data, select=c("Country","Year","dRGDP","debtgdp"))
Data$ccode <- countrycode(Data$Country, "country.name", "cown")

Data$dgcat <- NA
Data$dgcat[Data$debtgdp > 0 & Data$debtgdp < 30] <- "0-30%"
Data$dgcat[Data$debtgdp >= 30 & Data$debtgdp < 60] <- "30-60%"
Data$dgcat[Data$debtgdp >= 60 & Data$debtgdp < 90] <- "60-90%"
Data$dgcat[Data$debtgdp >= 90] <- "90% and above"

Data$dgcat2 <- NA
Data$dgcat2[Data$debtgdp > 0 & Data$debtgdp < 30] <- "0-30%"
Data$dgcat2[Data$debtgdp >= 30 & Data$debtgdp < 60] <- "30-60%"
Data$dgcat2[Data$debtgdp >= 60 & Data$debtgdp < 90] <- "60-90%"
Data$dgcat2[Data$debtgdp >= 90 & Data$debtgdp < 120] <- "90-120%"
Data$dgcat2[Data$debtgdp >= 120] <- "Above 120%"
```
\normalsize

### Regression Analysis

\scriptsize
```{r}
summary(M1 <- lm(dRGDP ~ factor(dgcat), data=Data))

```

\normalsize

### Regression Analysis

\scriptsize
```{r}
summary(M2 <- lm(dRGDP ~ factor(dgcat2), data=Data))

```

\normalsize

### Be Mindful What Your Regression is Saying

Did anyone see something amiss?

- Let's use `Zelig` to show the problem here.

\scriptsize
```{r eval=FALSE}
Data$dgcat <- as.factor(Data$dgcat)
summary(Z1 <- zelig(dRGDP ~ dgcat, data = Data, model="ls"))

Z1.low <- setx(Z1, dgcat  = "90% and above")
summary(Z1.sim <-sim(Z1, x = Z1.low))
```
\normalsize

### Expected Values of GDP Growth for >90% Debt

```{r echo=FALSE}
Z1.sim$stats[1]
```

See the problem now?

### RR's Summary Statistics

```{r echo=FALSE}
RR.correct.mean.df
```

The expected value of Y we got makes sense with the intercept (and these means), but it's not what RR reported.

- So what happened?

### Why Can't We Replicate RR?

Why can't we replicate RR's Figure 2 (and Table 1 from the Appendix)?

1. RR make curious case exclusions of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand shortly after WWII.
    - Argument: they're unique because it's WWII (a sui generis event).
    - However: they include the U.S. during that time.
2. RR also had a silly spreadsheet error that came from doing their work in Excel.
    - This omits Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, and Denmark from their analysis.
3. RR weight means equally by country rather than country year.
    - i.e. the U.S. has four years in the highest debt category (growth: -2%)
    - the UK has 19 years in the highest debt category (growth: 2.4%)
    - However, the four U.S. observations are weighted equally with the U.K.'s 19 years.
    
### Correct Means per Debt Category

```{r echo=FALSE}
RR.correct.mean.df
```

### What RR Reported

```{r echo=FALSE}
RR.published.mean.df
```

### Look Familiar?

![The disputed statistics in question (from the NBER working paper)](rr2010atab1.png)

### Another Look at the Debt/GDP Relationship

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(Graph)
```

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

RR still influence policy debates on debt and economic growth.

- However, their findings suffer from *major* inferential and workflow failures.

Don't make their mistakes when you do this yourself.
