# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Describe variables by reference to central tendency and dispersion.*

### Defining and Measuring Variables

Last lecture focused on a typology of variables.

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval

Correct classification will condition how we can *describe* variables.

# Central Tendency
### Central Tendency

The most common description of interest is the **central tendency**.

- This is the variables "typical", or "average" value.
- This takes on different forms contingent on variable type.

Think of what follows as a "tool kit" for researchers.

- More precise variables allow for more precise measures.
- Use the right tool for the job, if you will.

### Mode

The **mode** is the most basic central tendency statistic.

- It identifies the most frequently occurring value.

Suppose I have a random sample of 50 students and measured party affiliation.

- Democrats: 26; Republicans: 20; Others: 4

What's the modal category?

### Mode

If I randomly grabbed a student from that sample and guessed "Democrat", I would be right 26 times of 50 (on average).

- No other guess, on average, would be as good.

This is the only central tendency statistic for nominal variables.

### Median

The **median** is the middlemost value.

- It's the most precise statistic for ordinal variables.
- It's a useful robustness check for interval variables too.

Formally, a median *m* exists when the following equalities are satisfied.

\begin{equation}
	P(X \le m) \ge \frac{1}{2} \; \textrm{and} \;  P(X \ge m) \ge \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

### Finding the Median

Order the observations from lowest to highest and find what value lies in the exact middle.

- The median is the point where half the values lie below and half are above.
- We can do this when our variables have some kind of "order".
- Medians of nominal variables are nonsensical.

### Mean

The arithmetic **mean** is used only for interval variables.

- This is to what we refer when we say "average".

Formally, *i* through *n*:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{n}\Sigma x_i
\end{equation}

We can always describe interval variables with mode and median.

- We cannot do the same for ordinal or nominal with the mean.

# Dispersion
### Dispersion

We also need to know variables by reference to its **dispersion**.

- i.e. "how average is 'average'?"
- How far do variables deviate from the typical value?
- If they do, measures of central tendency can be misleading.

The interval variable with no dispersion problem is one in which the mode, median, and mean are the same value.

- This will not happen when there is a significant **skew**, or a **bimodal** distribution.

### Frequency Distribution

A **frequency distribution** is a summary of a variable's values.

### Cumulative Percentage

A **cumulative percentage** is the percentage of cases at or below a given value.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Here are some final thoughts.

- There is a reason we discuss "median income" and not the "average income".
- The mean of a dummy variable communicates the percentage of 1s, divided by 100.
- Skew is mostly a problem of mean variables, and a problem of degree.

Always look carefully at your data!
