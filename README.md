POSC 3410
=========

This repository contains my course notes and other supporting material for [POSC 3410](http://www.svmiller.com/teaching/posc-3410-quantitative-methods-in-political-science/), a quantitative methods class I teach at Clemson University.

The contents of this directory can be considered "volatile". I may pull an entire directory (or the whole thing) at my discretion (e.g. when the class starts anew another semester).
